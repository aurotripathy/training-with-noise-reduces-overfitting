# Training With Noise to Reduces Overfitting

This example illustrates the smoothing effects of training with input jitter.

## The Dataset

The dataset has only 31 points and two classes. I came across it in Russel Reed's book, Neural Smithing (page 282). The data isn't (digitally) available anywhere, so I had to recreate it by hand (it was fun to work once again with a ruler and pencil). 



## The Model

## Intentional Overfit

## Smoothing with Jitter
